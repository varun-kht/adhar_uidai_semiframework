# Intelligent State-Level Operational Prioritization Semi-Framework  
## A Machine Learning Approach to Proactive Resource Allocation

---

## 🏆 Overview

India’s Aadhaar ecosystem is the world’s largest digital identity infrastructure, processing millions of enrolment and update transactions across 36 States and Union Territories every month. Given the scale and operational heterogeneity, traditional threshold-based monitoring systems are insufficient to proactively identify operational stress, emerging risks, or resource bottlenecks.

This project presents a **data-driven, explainable, and scalable analytical framework** that leverages **time-series analysis and unsupervised machine learning** to automatically identify and rank states requiring priority administrative attention. The framework enables a transition from **reactive reporting to proactive governance**.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

**How can historical Aadhaar enrolment and biometric update data be used to proactively identify states requiring operational intervention in a transparent and scalable manner?**

### Limitations of Existing Approaches
- Static thresholds ignore state-specific operational context  
- High false positives for low-volume states  
- Inability to detect proportional or emerging declines  
- Lack of multi-dimensional risk assessment  

---

## 💡 Solution Approach

The framework integrates **three complementary analytical signals** into a composite priority score:

### 1. Trend Deviation Analysis
- Measures deviation from state-specific historical baselines using rolling averages  
- Captures emerging operational deterioration  

### 2. Anomaly Detection (Isolation Forest)
- Unsupervised machine learning model to detect statistically unusual operational behavior  
- Does not require labeled training data  

### 3. Biometric Load Assessment
- Quantifies sustained biometric processing pressure  
- Highlights infrastructure and capacity stress  

These signals are normalized, weighted, and fused into a **Composite Priority Score**, accompanied by **human-readable explanations** to ensure interpretability for policymakers.

## 🧠 Key Innovations

- First application of **Isolation Forest** on Aadhaar operational data  
- State-contextual baselines instead of absolute national thresholds  
- Explainable AI layer for administrative decision-making  
- Production-grade, reproducible analytical pipeline  
- Scalable to district-level and near real-time monitoring
